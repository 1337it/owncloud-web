Change: Show dedicated 404 page for invalid resource references

When visiting a public link or the `All files` files list with an invalid resource in the URL (e.g. because it was deleted in the meantime) we now show a dedicated page which explains
the the resource could not be found and which offers a link to go back to the respective root (»All files« home location or the root of the public link).
