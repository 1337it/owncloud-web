Change: Bring UI/UX of file links sidebar in line with sharing sidebar

The file links sidebar had inline forms for link creation/editing while the sharing
sidebar navigates to a new panel when showing forms. Also, within the file link
creation/editing form the role selection was solved through radio buttons while
roles for collaborators are selected through a dropdown menu. We adapted both
UI aspects of the file links sidebar to resemble the sharing sidebar.
