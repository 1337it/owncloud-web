Bugfix: Clean router path handling

This patch was already introduced earlier for the files application only.
In the meantime we found out that this is also needed on different places across the ecosystem.

We've refactored the way how the patch get applied to the routes, to do so set the meta.patchCleanPath to true on the individual route.
