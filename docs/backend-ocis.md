## Setting up OCIS services

- Setup OCIS by cloning the [ocis repository](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis) and following the setup instructions there.
- Do not start the whole server but run `./bin/ocis --log-level debug $EXTENSION` for all the existing extensions **except the web service**. A list of extensions can be found by running `./bin/ocis` without arguments and looking at the "Extensions" section.

## Setting up Web

- Please note that config.json is generated by ocis-web so there is no need to create one.
- If you want to provide a config.json file, you can do so by starting ocis with `WEB_UI_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json`

## Running Web

- in the Web checkout folder, run `yarn serve`
- open [https://localhost:9200](https://localhost:9200) and accept the certificate.
- when signing in, use one of the [available test users](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis#quickstart)
- whenever code changes are made, you need to manually reload the browser page (no hot reload)

## Running acceptance tests

For testing, please refer to the [OCIS testing section]({{< ref "testing.md#running-acceptance-tests-using-ocis-backend" >}})
